Suppose Fundu Parking Garage contains 10 parking lanes, each with a capacity to hold 10 cars at a time. As each car arrives/departs, the values A/D (representing arrival /departure) is entered along with the car registration number. If a car is departing the data should get updated. If a new car is arriving then on the screen a message should be displayed indicating suitable parking slot for the car. Cars arrive at the south end of the garage and leave from the north end. If a customer arrives to pick up a car that is not the nothernmost, all cars to the north of the car are moved out, the car is driven out, and the other cars are restored in the same order that they were in originally. Whenever a car leaves, all cars to the south are moved forward so that at all times all the empty spaces are in the south part of the garage. Write a program that implements this parking system.
